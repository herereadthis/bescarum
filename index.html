                * That part is the result of an A/B Test, implemented by a guy named Greg Linden.
                * Actually, marketing senior vice president was very against it because he thought adding more additional information would overload the user when the use should be focused on checking out.
                * So Greg Linden stuck the code in there in an A/B Test
                * It turns out that implementing that feature made them a ton of money

                * Sorry, I'm gonna skip multivariate testing (or at least the math for it) because it is nuts
                complicated
                * Everything that makes A/B testing complicated is orders of magnitude crazier when you introduce
                multi-dimensional parameters
                * Towards the end of part of Bayesian statics I'll mention briefly a family of tools called Markov Chain
                Monte Carlo simulations, which is one of the major elements of multivariate testing.

                        critical business and technical decisions can be made over A/B testing analysis, we have to be

                * What is **Statistic**? Information that can be computed from data
                  * **Pure Statistics** - a single value computed from data, such as a sample average
                  * **Interval Statistics** - an interval [*a, b*] computed from data.
                * **Statistical Inference** - draw conclusions about a large data set by analyzing smaller sets of data

                * **Parameter estimation** - some value that determines the properties of the distribution, such as
                \\(\mu\\) or \\(\sigma\\)
                * **Data Prediction** - use information about sample to predict a random selection
                * **Model comparison** - selecting a model which best explains the observed data, something that
                postulates the relationship between factors and the data

                grew into modern statistics.

                * Maybe after 2000 observations there's some regression
                * This is major problem with so many A/B testing services. They allow you to track progress.
                * They kinda have to. It's what the client wants. They can't just say, okay run your test, check back in
                a few weeks.
                * That is the dilemma. I'm sure all those A/B testing services have Ph.D statisticians working for them,
                and they are all probably saying over to the marketing team: STOP PEEKING, but the marketing team can't
                just sell a mystery black box to clients.
